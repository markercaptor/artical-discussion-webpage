                        In the article they start by talking about a moonless night during 1859. On this night the northern lights seemed to have streched across the globe.
                        this due to a giant storm in space that was taking place. This storm caused massive issues for the ability to commincate long distance as it disrupted the telegraph system.
                        They then go on to say that even though we do not use the telgraph system these kind of storms could still cause massive blackouts and cause massive destruction accross the globe.
                        Since this is a possibility from any storms that could happen in space. Researchers have collectivly decided to make up a team led by MIT that aims to make software that will be able to more accuratly predicte future space storms.
                        They primarly want to focus on near earth space for now as it would be the easiest to start with then be able to expand from there.
                        The software they aim to make is a flexible software that would be able to take in huge sets of observational data that can then be easily shared.
                        They also plan to use a high programming language calld julia for this software as they will be able to curtail/ tailor the software for each set of researchers needs without needing to rewrite the program from scratch.

                        This article seems to be a rather interesting view into the scientfic side of computer programming. This being that when people generally think of
                        programming they tend to lean to cyber security, hacking, or game programming. Since they are looking at this section of programming more it is interesting to see that applications
                        that a higher level prgramming language is able to do. As Julia the one they have chosen is set to build a software that will let the users share data and do what they need to do with it without
                        the need to reqrite the software to fit each person/teams needs. If they are able to successfully launch the software in the method.
                        That they intend to then this would open up a lot of possibilites for what the scientific community can learn about space and how to end up help protecting our
                        technology from being overly affected by future space storms.
